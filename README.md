Repository

Access was denied to me again. I went through the steps of merging with files and was met with this error. My last resort resulted in me creating a personal repository that is set to public to push my github project

  Update:

I have tried to push the updated work with the css to my previous repository but was met with this error

Which resulted me in creating a brand new repository to push my updated work. The repository is set to public but im afraid its still being difficult and will provide a 403 error

Second Proposal

Overview
Name: GeoPets

GeoPets is essentially a hotel or a caretaking place for pets of every kind. Owners can place bookings to leave their pets to be taken care of if the owners are going away. The hotel will consist of different sections that separate pets if requested by owner, or if the pets are of different breeds and sizes. Staff will tend to the food and water of the pets along with any further instructions given by owners, for example, medication or exercise. GeoPets will also offer the option to provide pet training, and grooming to the pets for an additional price.
